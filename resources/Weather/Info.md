This is for Yahoo weather api that contains 0-47 different weather code and 3200 error code.

Artwork inspired from [Weather Icons](http://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/).

Due to the limitation of eink display, many weather condition are sharing same icon, yet I still named them to code number for easy reference.
