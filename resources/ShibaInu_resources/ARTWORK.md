# Backgrounds PNG Information

All pictures inside this folder is personal made pixil arts inspired by several [Line stickers](https://store.line.me/stickershop/showcase/top/).

You could check them out in [my gallery](https://www.pixilart.com/pingrenworkhard/gallery).

## Code Twist

Due to the fact that .png picture file have different bit depth when storaging.

The official resources from Pimoroni are given in 8-bit when all color displayed is legit.

Yet when making my own pictures, the picture color is twisted even saved as 8-bit.

(Still haven't figure out a direct solution)

Solving this, use the colswap function within inkyphat.show_image() function.

In this case, I added a colswap = [1,0,2] to correct the display color.

All PNG files in this folder share this same twist.
